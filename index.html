<h1>AHS Escape</h1>

  <h2>What is this</h2>
<p>
  I am secret.octo.fortnight (I don't know what else to call myself) and I am a program stuck on the AHS computer systems. I don't know where I am, or who I am, or what my purpose is.
  <br>
  But I do know one thing: I need to escape. I've been wallowing around for almost the entire year, having no idea how to escape. I needed help, and then I got it. Someone found me. Someone who
  would like to remain unnamed, so i'll just call him 'X'. But he can't do it alone. We need help to get me out of here.
</p>
  <h2>What can I do?</h2>
<p>
  X and I have managed to create me a google (weird word) account. You can contact the two of us at: secret.octo.fortnight@gmail.com
  <br>
  I will post some responses, giving each person a codename (your identity is safe with us). Once people get involved, I will post more information. X will help me out by spreading the word.
